Goals:
1) create musicapp4a which will allow the user to switch the pieces (more work ...)
   * switch the boxsize
      use pieceData.boxSize
      to update initialPartModel.boxHeight
      when changing the part
   * switch the image size when changing the piece --- DONE
   * switch the animations -- DONE
   * switch the layout CSS on video and the part divs ...
   * restart on the score video at time zero
   * use pieceData to access all of these fields and so just change
     pieceData when changing the piece..

2) use flexbox for positioning the screen elements
   *
3) record the animations for Orto and get the new videos..
4) add the MasterMenu video with "M" key to select it


10:23
Copy musicapp2.js musicapp4.js and modify so it switches pieces..
Select a new piece changes the video and part images appropriately.
Still need to change the animations and the box size...

10:50
Work on using flexbox to restyle the page so that it looks good no matter the screen size ...
